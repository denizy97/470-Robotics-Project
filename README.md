## Project Update 1
No new code was written for this update. This update was merely a declaration of our project statement. The end goal of our project is to have a car that interacts with a robotic arm as well as multiple sensors. We would like to have the car follow some predetermined path (using sensors), reach a certain point and stop, and use the robotic arm to provide some service to the car such as changing the tires after which the car will continue on its way. For more information on the project statement, see our individual project update documents.
